# usb-mp3player
A PIC based MP3 player with USB interface

Target hardware PIC18F2550
Written in C for XC8 C compiler, was originally written for HTC but that was going nowhere :3

I'm tryina fix some bugs, esp with the custom fileio libraries, will build on MPLAB X ide and upload the makefile and source code (hexadecimal)

Once the source is up, you may try programming your hardware and test it. PICKit 2/3 is recommended.

Please come back soon! And also don't hesitate to start a pull request should you find issues with the code - this will help expedite the debugging
  |_ because I'm sure there are many (bugs)!!
